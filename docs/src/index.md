# TightBindingTookit.jl

TightBindingToolkit.jl is a Julia package meant for constructing, and obtaining useful properties of generic tight-binding models. It supports any lattice structure, with any user-defined bonds on that lattice. It also has support for any spin of the particle hopping on the lattice.

Currently supported :
* Custom Unit Cell Construction. (v1.3) : now also supports construction in dimensions upto d=3.

    |*Honeycomb Model with 1st, 2nd and 3rd neighbour hoppings.*|
* Corresponding Brillouin Zone Construction. (v1.3) : now also supports construction in dimensions upto d=3.
* Hamiltonian, given a Unit Cell and a Brillouin Zone. (v1.3) : now also support BdG Hamiltonians.
* Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in momentum space to get band structures and wavefunctions.
